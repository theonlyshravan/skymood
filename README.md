## 🌤️ What is Sky Mood?

**Sky Mood** is a sleek and beginner-friendly weather web app that lets you check the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city around the world — all while vibing in style. Think of it as your chill weather buddy.

Built as a final JavaScript project to flex my newly-acquired JS skills, this app shows that even small projects can have big personality.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time weather data for **any city**
- 5-day forecast with cool icons
- **Glassmorphism UI** – smooth, modern look
- Responsive design – works on phones too!
- **OpenWeatherMap API** integrated

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – for semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – with animations, responsive layout & a frosty glass effect  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – pure and simple  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – to fetch real-time weather and forecasts  

---

## 💻 How It Works

1. Type in any city.
2. Hit **Search** or press Enter.
3. Boom – current weather and 5-day forecast slide into view like a weather ninja.
4. Enjoy the smooth animations and stylish design. (Umbrella not included.)

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

- No backend – the API key is exposed (temporarily okay for demo).
- No error UI for edge cases like typos (alerts are used for now).
- Forecast logic is based on one reading per day – simple but effective.

---

## 🤓 Why I Made This

Because learning JavaScript was fun, and this project was the perfect way to connect it with a real-world API. Plus, weather apps are like the “hello world” of APIs — but way cooler if you give them personality.

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Add loading animations
- Use a backend to hide the API key securely
- Show more detailed weather data (like sunrise, sunset, etc.)
- Add a **dark mode** (because devs love that)

**Made with code, clouds, and curiosity.**
